I am currently pursuing Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [Vision and Learning Lab](https://yonseivnl.github.io/) at Yonsei Unviersity. I am glad to be advised by Prof. [Jonghyun Choi](http://ppolon.github.io/). Before joining our group, I worked at Samsung Electronics as an mechanical engineer after I received B.S. in ME at Yonsei University.
